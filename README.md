I'm a recent graduate (Nov 2021) holding a **Bachelor's in Computer Science** from Tennessee State University! 🎓📜

I have formal experience and proficiency in software engineering in the languages **Python, Java, MySQL, and C#** from college, but I have been learning **BASH and Linux System Administration** in general on my own.
